You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.

Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.
Example 2:

Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.
Example 3:

Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1

sol : i simmoly run a loop and finding out the given number factor and pushing in vector and then check if k is less than our vector size than we return v[k-1]   because  vector initialize using 0 so v[k-1]
and if not then return -1

code : 

int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> v = {1};
        
        for(int i=2; i<=n ; i++){
            if(n%i==0){
                v.push_back(i);
            }
        }
       
        if(k <= v.size()){
            return v[k-1];
        }
        else{
            return -1;
        }
        
        
    }
