Given a positive integer n, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.
Example 2:

Input: n = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 2 is 6. Note that a number is a multiple of itself.
this the problem.
Solution: 
i thought that if it is multply by 2 and also the multiple of given number so if it given number factor is 2 then we need to divide by that and after that need to multipy by  2 
and if it is factor is not 2 then simply multiply by 2
code : 
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        int ans =0;
        if(n %2 ==0){
            n = n/2;
            ans = 2*n;
        }
        else{
            ans = n*2;
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
};
