Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.

An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.

 Example 1:

Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
Example 2:

Input: a = 25, b = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.

sol : first finding out which is small a or b
then iterate loop untill small 
every iteration checked both number is divisible by current i if yes then count++;
after return count
 

code : 
int commonFactors(int a, int b) {

        int m = min(a , b);
        int count = 0;
        for(int i =1; i <=m; i++){
            if(a % i== 0 && b % i== 0){
                count+=1;
            }

        }
        return count;
        
    }
